                <h1>How to Build a Top-Notch Remote Marketing Team</h1>
            </header>
            <section>
                <p class="bold">As more organizations are conducting business digitally, remote working has also become more commonplace.</p>
                <p>In fact, <a href="#" target="_blank">77% of virtual companies</a> with over 2,500 employees offer the option of telecommuting while 20% of the global workforce is part of a remote team. Remote working allows employers to reduce overhead cost and tap into a larger talent pool to increase profitability.</p>
                <p>This is particularly beneficial for highly specialized disciplines such as marketing, which requires expert knowledge and skillsets. A virtual marketing team allows organizations to attract experts from all over the world and establish a presence in the global marketplace cost-efficiently.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, remote workers enjoy more flexibility in their schedule and location. They are also found to be <a href="#" target="_blank">happier and more productive</a>, which can translate into higher employee satisfaction and retention.</p>
                <p>However, managing a remote marketing team can be quite challenging due to many factors that did not exist in the past. These include the lack of in-person relationship-building opportunities, higher chances of miscommunications that lead to errors and delays, as well as differences in time zone, location, and cultural backgrounds. In addition, the cross-department lack of communication that can be created in an office setting can be amplified in remote teams that never communicate with other remote teams in different parts of the organization. </p>
                <h2>Hire the Right Remote Employees</h2>
                <p>Marketing is a discipline that requires a deep understanding of customers’ psychology and behaviors. You need to hire team members that not only have the required knowledge but also the ability to tap into consumer sentiments and turn them into actionable insights proactively.</p>
                <p>High-quality candidates should demonstrate their abilities to take initiative during the interviewing process (e.g., by following up proactively), stay organized, complete assignments autonomously, and make decisions independently.</p>

                <h2>Communicate Your Company Vision and Brand Value</h2>
                <p>Effective marketing requires a deep understanding of your brand’s image and values. Everyone in your virtual marketing team should have a good grasp of what your brand stands for so they can be empowered to proactively take on initiatives that align with your business objectives.</p>
                <p>Look for candidates that are <strong>enthusiastic</strong> about your products. They should have done their homework to understand your brand and research about your target audience. They should also have the ability to articulate your brand values during the interviewing process.</p>
                <q>Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do.</q> 
                <h2>Implement a Comprehensive Onboarding Process</h2> 
                <p>Since your virtual marketing team members will be working remotely on their own, you need a comprehensive onboarding process to make sure that they <strong>understand</strong> the internal workflows, communication protocols, and other operational procedures so they can work independently.</p> 
                <p>Provide comprehensive training on the communication and collaboration tools you have put in place – after all, your team won’t achieve the best outcomes if they don’t know how to use the applications to maximize productivity and optimize results.</p> 
                <p>Also, remote employees need to connect to your systems and access customer information using their own networks and equipment. Given the high cost associated with data breaches, cybersecurity is no longer an option for companies using virtual teams. </p>
                <h2>Ways to Define and Reach Your Target Market on Social Media</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Listen to Your Audience</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Listening to what people are saying on social media helps you know their needs, frustrations, fears, goals, and desires, helping you understand what makes them engage with you. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Test Different Types of Copy</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The tone and style you use in your social media posts elicit different emotions in your audience, determining whether they will engage with you or not. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Share High-Quality Content</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your content provides answers to their questions and solves their problems, so you’ll start earning their trust and drive engagement with them. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Use Different Lead Magnets</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>So when deciding the type of lead magnet to use, remember that it needs to offer a specific promise, an example, a shortcut, and answer a burning question or offer a discount. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Expand Your Reach</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Look for shows talking about the content you’re already sharing, come up with relevant topics, then request to appear as a guest. </li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
